# SOLAR-Smart-Optimization-Learning-Algorithms-Repository

‚öôÔ∏èSOLAR: Smart Optimization & Learning Algorithms Repository
This repository is part of the research activities conducted in the Lab of Amin Asadi and Abolfazl Maleki. It serves as a centralized platform for storing and sharing learning-based algorithm implementations developed for various problem domains, mostly in the field of transportation and logistics!

Each project in this repository includes two main files:

Project Description File: provides an overview of the problem, its formulation, and relevant background information (if any).

Algorithm Implementation File: contains the implementation of the proposed or studied algorithm.

The naming convention for the implementation files follows this pattern: "AlgorithmName-ProblemName.ipynb" (or other suffix based on the programming language) where "ProblemName.md" itself corresponds to the description file detailing the problem context.

üí°Repository Structure and Updates
This repository is continuously updated as new algorithms and problem formulations are developed or improved. Because of this active development process, file structures, naming conventions, or code implementations may change over time.
The codes available here always represent the latest versions and reflect the most recent updates made by the research team.
